# Global Ecosystems Atlas Annotations Dashboard

## Overview
The Global Ecosystems Atlas initiative is developing a standard global set of occurrence records of IUCN Ecosystem Functional Groups to support spatial models tasked with estimating the distribution of each Ecosystem Functional Group. This repo houses a set of tools and applications for monitoring the status of the development of the training and validation dataset.

## Global Training Dataset Statistics
An application for visualising summary statistics on the current state of the global training and validation dataset, offering multiple views across several parameters with filtering options.

## Training Data Viewer
A google earth engine app to visualises the global training and validation dataset and show the distribution of points that have been labelled so far by the JCU Global Ecosystems Atlas annotations team.

## Future Annotations Planning App
A Google Earth Engine app that displays the future annotation regions of the JCU Global Ecosystems Atlas annotations team. Click on a project grid to get the unique project ID, the number of training and validation points in each project grid, and the number of points that fall within places that are already or expected to be represented in the Global Ecosystems Atlas synthesis map (Data shared with GEA or Engagement Countries). Note: Regions with limited ecosystem data or few engagement opportunities are typically prioritized for annotation.
